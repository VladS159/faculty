Remember:
• In order to save your changes, you have to recompile the project from the
’Recompile’ green button.
• A disadvantage of using Overleaf (free edition) in big teams is that the
owner of the project can share the project with only one editor, so the
other teammates from the team won’t be able to make changes to the
files. But you can split your work and everyone can write a chapter or at
least some sections and you can combine them in the end.
• Each one of you will have to upload the documentation on Campus. I will
read only one documentation from each team (they have to be the same)
and I will read only the answers to the conclusions chapter (I expect
them to be unique because I assume each one of you has a different
opinion).
• You documentation should not be longer than 12 pages. I know for some
of you it’s harder to come up with a lot of words, but remember that the
documentation also has tables, code sequences, figures.
