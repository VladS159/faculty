Learn  to design algorithms that are correct and efficient
How do we know that:
an algorithm is correct ? ->  correctness proofs
an algorithm is efficient ?  ->  analysis of algorithms (time complexity)
How to design solutions for new problems ?
Learning general techniques for design
Studying a set of well-known algorithms, to serve as examples of success stories for applying  general design techniques
Become aware that good algorithms are key parts of software engineering practice !
