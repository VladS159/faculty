General Description:
This application aims to help both clients and restaurants by offering the possibility to
increase restaurant revenues and offer easy access to a huge variety of dishes to customers.
Registration (for both Customer and Restaurant):
The user needs to first register into the application by selecting one of the 2 roles: client or
restaurant manager. Both roles require a unique username, a password and the basic
information like full name / restaurant name, address and phone number.
Restaurant:
After the restaurant manager logs in, he can add, edit or delete the items on his menu. A
menu item should contain its name, calories number, price and optionally a picture.
Also, after logging in, he will see a list of the orders for the current day.
From the list of orders, the restaurant can reject or approve an order, specifying a rejection
reason, or respectively the estimated delivery time.
Customer:
A customer needs to login into the application where he will be able to see a list with all the
restaurants. The list should be searchable by the restaurantâ€™s name.
A logged in customer can also see the products of a specific restaurant, by selecting the
restaurant from the list.
Also, logged in customers can select any quantity for any number of menu items for a single
restaurant, and create an order containing the selected items.
A logged in customer can also see a list of past orders, with their status (accepted, rejected,
pending or delivered). If the order is rejected, the rejection reason will also be displayed. If
the order has been accepted, the estimated delivery time will also be displayed. A customer
will mark an accepted order as delivered
